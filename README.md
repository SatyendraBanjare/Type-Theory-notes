# Verified Computer Programs and Type Theory - A short report

This is a report on advancements in type theory and formalized proof-based programming languages often referred to as verified programming languages. I have tried to explain the importance of mathematical modelling and logic system development based on the ancient works of mathematicians like Per-Martin Lof$^{1}$  by the applications in present programming toolchain and possible future aspects like applications in a quantum  programming toolchain.

I have also added some of the used references in here.
