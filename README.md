# Logic Systems, Type Theory & Applications of Program Verification

These are some of my notes on stuffs that I have been reading these days like type theory and proof assistants with a small part covering Quantum computing and applications of program verification in quantum computing. It is compiled as a report that focuses on advancements in logic systems and formalized proof-based programming languages often referred to as verified programming languages.

I have also added some of the used references in here. 

For building pdf from .tex files, use following command. Make sure that Latex is installed in your system.

``` bash
-$ cd files
