\section{Certigrad}
A recent paper\cite{certigrad} by \textit{Daniel Selsam} verifies the computation graph of machine learning model. The project \textbf{Certigrad}\cite{certigrad_video} explains that it is very possible that conventional debugging techniques fail to explain ambiguous nature of a ML model failure (like memory overflow and corruption) that may be a result of setting some hyper-parameters or a flaw in program logic. Say for example the one of the functions diverge at a certain point then it might be very difficult to track that simple using a debugger. However when verified using a proof assistant, it correctly suggestes that the unexpected behaviour is outcome of mathematical error and not program logic. Similar logic can thus be extended to verify computation graphs of every machine learning model. 

\section{Automated Proving}
While correcting ML model using program verification, new kind of proof assistant \textbf{Proving Ground}\cite{provingground} by Professor \textit{Siddhartha Gadgil} is also being developed that uses AI to help reduce steps furthermore.
